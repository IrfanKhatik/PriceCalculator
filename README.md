Price calculator is demo sample app, the following discounts apply:
1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45
as a discount).
5. The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.
6. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.
